So it makes me thinking, why not put them together to make an awesome game.\r\n\r\nFor years we've been dreaming to wield a lightsaber or fight dragons with a legendary sword. Although it's difficult to accomplish this in the real world, but in virtual reality, everything is possible. Especially with the Hydra controller which is a magnetic field tracker capable of tracking the position and orientation of the user's hand.With the powerful UE4 implementing the Hydra into VR environment has never been easier.\r\n\r\nSo here we precent the project S.A.O. which stands for Sword Art Outside, a real sword fighting game I used to play with my friends using harmless foam weapons. This game aims to recreate the realistic experience of sword fighting. In this game attack is more than just pressing buttons. You can slash in whatever direction you want. With UE4's destructible mesh we can create a highly interactive game with intuitive control system. There will be dozens of weapons to choose from. You will be able to parry enemy's attack, deflect laser blaster bolt, or even perform sophisticated sword skills. And there's more to come.\r\n\r\nThe game is currently under development and it's fully open sourse. The recent progress will be updated on the Github page.\r\n###To play the demo: \r\nOpen the project with Unreal Engine 4 Editor.\r\nRazer Hydra controller is Required. Oculus Rift is Recommended.\r\n\r\n+ Play in VR Preview mode if you have an Oculus.\r\n+ Swing the controllers to slash.\r\n+ Press the Trigger to fire guns.\r\n+ Move with left joystick and Rotate with right joystick.\r\n\r\n###To view the source code: \r\nDownload the project folder and open with UE4.\r\n\r\n## Authors and Contributors\r\nDirector: Dun Mao\r\nAll the artwork comes from the Epic games Infinity Blade asset packages.\r\n\r\nPlease do not use this work for commercial purposes, thank you.\r\n","google":"","note":"Don't delete this file!
